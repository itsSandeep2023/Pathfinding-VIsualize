# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to the Pathfinding Visualizer! This tool is designed to help you understand and visualize various pathfinding algorithms in real-time. Whether you're a student learning about algorithms or a developer looking to see different pathfinding techniques in action, this visualizer is here to help.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Create and modify a grid to set up obstacles and define the start and end points.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Visualize the behavior of different pathfinding algorithms, including:
  - A* (A Star)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the algorithms in action with real-time updates as they search for the shortest path.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust algorithm-specific settings to see how they impact the search process and results.
- **Path Highlighting**: See the calculated path clearly highlighted on the grid.
